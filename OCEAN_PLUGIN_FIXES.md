# Ocean Plugin Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Evaluator Validation Logic Fixed
**Problem**: The memory extraction evaluator was always returning `false` and showing "0 messages since last extraction"

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Fixed message counting logic**: Now properly counts messages since last extraction
- **Lowered content threshold**: Reduced from 100 to 50 characters for substantial content
- **Improved cache key handling**: Better cache key management for tracking last processed message
- **Added timestamp-based triggering**: Also triggers extraction after 5 minutes even with fewer messages
- **Reduced extraction interval**: Changed from 3 to 2 messages for more frequent extraction
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed debug logs to show validation process

### 2. ✅ Action Validation Enhanced  
**Problem**: Ocean plugin actions weren't being validated or triggered properly

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Enhanced keyword matching**: Added more keywords for publish and list actions
- **Improved error handling**: Added try-catch blocks with proper error logging  
- **Better debug logging**: Added detailed validation logs for both actions
- **Service availability checks**: Proper validation of Ocean service availability

### 3. ✅ Network Configuration Aligned
**Problem**: Network mismatch between Safe plugin (Ethereum Sepolia) and Ocean plugin (Optimism mainnet)

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Safe Plugin**: Updated to use Optimism Sepolia (chain ID 11155420)
- **Ocean Plugin**: Updated to use Optimism Sepolia by default
- **RPC URLs**: Both plugins now use `https://sepolia.optimism.io`
- **Enhanced Ocean Node connectivity**: Multiple endpoint checking for better connection detection

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Memory Extraction Evaluator:
```
✅ Ocean memory extraction validation: 2 messages since last extraction, substantial content: true, time since last: 45s, should extract: true
✅ Ocean memory extraction processed: 2 memories extracted
```

### Action Validation:
```
✅ PublishMemory action validation: text="publish my career goals...", hasIntent=true, serviceAvailable=true, result=true
✅ ListAssets action validation: text="show my assets...", hasListIntent=true, hasAssetTerm=false, serviceAvailable=true, result=true
```

### Network Alignment:
```
✅ Connected to network: optimism-sepolia (chainId: 11155420)
✅ Ocean Node connection successful at: http://localhost:8001
```

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Memory Extraction
Have a conversation with the agent with meaningful content (50+ characters):
```
User: "I'm working on a sustainable tech startup focused on battery storage optimization. I need help with fundraising and go-to-market strategy."
```

You should see in logs:
- Memory extraction validation showing positive results
- Actual memory extraction happening every 2-3 messages
- Memories being processed and potentially published (if auto-publish is enabled)

### 2. Test Manual Publishing
Try requesting manual memory publishing:
```
User: "I want to publish my career goals as a DataNFT"
User: "Can you monetize my startup experience?"
User: "Turn my goals into an Ocean Protocol asset"
```

You should see:
- Action validation logs showing positive matches
- Publishing process being triggered
- Success/failure messages about DataNFT creation

### 3. Test Asset Listing
Try requesting to view published assets:
```
User: "Show me my Ocean assets"
User: "List my published DataNFTs" 
User: "What assets do I have?"
```

You should see:
- Action validation logs showing matches
- Portfolio information being displayed
- Asset statistics and details

## Configuration Changes Made

### Safe Plugin (`plugin-safe/src/plugin.ts`):
```typescript
// Changed from Ethereum Sepolia to Optimism Sepolia
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL: 'https://sepolia.optimism.io'
CHAIN_ID: 11155420  // Was 11155111
```

### Ocean Plugin (`plugin-ocean/src/plugin.ts`):
```typescript 
// Updated defaults for Optimism Sepolia
OPTIMISM_RPC_URL: 'https://sepolia.optimism.io'
OPTIMISM_CHAIN_ID: 11155420  // Was 10
```

### Evaluator Validation (`memoryExtractor.ts`):
```typescript
// More aggressive extraction
extractionInterval: 2  // Was 3
contentThreshold: 50   // Was 100
timeThreshold: 5 * 60 * 1000  // 5 minutes fallback
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Your Agent** to load the updated plugin code
2. **Test Memory Extraction** by having meaningful conversations
3. **Test Manual Actions** by requesting publishing or asset listing
4. **Monitor Logs** for the improved debug output
5. **Verify Network Consistency** - all operations should be on Optimism Sepolia

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Logs** for the new debug messages showing validation details
2. **Verify Ocean Node** is running and accessible
3. **Confirm Safe Wallets** are being created on Optimism Sepolia
4. **Test Actions** with the specific keywords mentioned in the validation
5. **Enable Auto-Publishing** with `OCEAN_AUTO_PUBLISH=true` for automatic memory publishing

The plugin should now properly extract memories from conversations and respond to user requests for publishing and listing Ocean Protocol assets.
