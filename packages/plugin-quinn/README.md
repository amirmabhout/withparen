# Plugin Quinn

Quinn is an AI agent focused on connection discovery. Unlike Seren which focuses on deepening existing connections, Quinn helps users discover new meaningful connections based on their passions, challenges, and connection preferences.

## Features

- **Onboarding Narrative**: Guides users through discovering their passions, challenges, and connection preferences
- **Persona Memory**: Tracks user background, goals, and preferences using the PEACOCK framework
- **Connection Discovery Insights**: Captures the type of connections users wish to discover
- **Vector-based Matchmaking**: Uses similarity search to find compatible connections
- **Smart Reasoning**: Evaluates mutual compatibility between potential matches

## How It Works

### 1. Onboarding Process

Quinn creates a natural conversation to understand:

- **Passions & Work**: What users are passionate about and currently working on
- **Challenges & Growth**: Where they face obstacles and need support
- **Connection Preferences**: What type of connections would help them grow

### 2. Profile Building

- Uses **personaMemory** provider to track user background using PEACOCK dimensions:
  - demographic, characteristic, routine, goal, experience, persona_relationship, emotional_state
- Uses **connectionMemory** provider to capture connection discovery preferences:
  - desired_type, desired_background, desired_goals, desired_experience, desired_communication, desired_value

### 3. Connection Discovery

When users are ready, they can trigger the "Discover Connection" action:

1. **Context Generation**: Creates personaContext (user's profile) and connectionContext (ideal match profile)
2. **Vector Search**: Performs similarity search across all user profiles
3. **Compatibility Analysis**: Uses reasoning to evaluate mutual compatibility
4. **Match Recommendation**: Suggests the best match for introduction

### 4. Reflection & Learning

The reflection evaluator continuously extracts insights from conversations to improve matching:

- Persona insights about the user themselves
- Connection discovery insights about what they're looking for

## Installation

```bash
npm install @elizaos/plugin-quinn
```

## Usage

Add to your agent configuration:

```typescript
import { quinnPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-quinn';

const agent = {
  plugins: [quinnPlugin],
  // ... other config
};
```

## Key Actions

- **DISCOVER_CONNECTION**: Main action for finding compatible connections
- **REPLY**: Standard conversation responses
- **IGNORE**: Skip responding to certain messages

## Key Providers

- **ONBOARDING**: Guides connection discovery onboarding flow
- **PERSONA_MEMORY**: Formats user persona insights
- **CONNECTION_MEMORY**: Formats connection discovery preferences

## Key Evaluators

- **QUINN_REFLECTION**: Extracts persona and connection discovery insights from conversations

## Dependencies

- @elizaos/core
- @elizaos/plugin-sql
- @elizaos/api-client

## Database Tables

Quinn uses the following SQL database tables:

- `persona_*` tables for PEACOCK framework dimensions
- `connection_*` tables for connection discovery preferences
- `persona_contexts` for generated user profiles
- `connection_contexts` for generated ideal match profiles

## Differences from Seren

- **Focus**: Connection discovery vs. connection deepening
- **Database**: SQL-only (no Memgraph dependency)
- **Matching**: Vector similarity search for compatibility
- **Goal**: Help users find new connections vs. strengthen existing ones
