## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### State Management & User Journey Flow

The plugin implements comprehensive state management tracking users through different journey stages based on their Circles group membership status and connection discovery outcomes.

#### Core State Entities

##### Match Records (`matches` table)
Tracks discovered connections between users with the following status progression:

- **`match_found`**: Initial compatibility discovered between two users
- **`group_onboarding`**: Non-member matched with member, needs to join Circles group first  
- **`group_joined`**: User successfully joined Circles group via trust transaction
- **`ready_for_introduction`**: Both users are verified group members, ready for introduction
- **`introduction_outgoing`**: Introduction proposal sent to matched user
- **`introduction_incoming`**: User received introduction proposal from their match
- **`introduction_accepted`**: Both parties agreed to be introduced
- **`introduction_completed`**: Introduction successfully facilitated

##### Invitation Records (`invitations` table)  
Tracks users invited to join the group when no matches are found:

- **`invitation_sent`**: Non-member invited to join group due to no available matches
- **`invitation_completed`**: User successfully joined group following invitation

#### Complete User Journey Flows

##### Flow 1: Existing Group Member Seeking Connections

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requests Connection] --> B[Check Group Membership]
    B --> C[Member: ✓]
    C --> D[Search for Matches]
    D --> E{Matches Found?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Create Match Record]
    F --> G[Status: ready_for_introduction]
    G --> H[Send Introduction Proposal]
    H --> I[Status: introduction_outgoing]
    I --> J{Other User Accepts?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Status: introduction_accepted]
    K --> L[Facilitate Introduction]
    L --> M[Status: introduction_completed]
    E -->|No| N[Send: Keep checking message]
```

##### Flow 2: Non-Member with Available Matches

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requests Connection] --> B[Check Group Membership]  
    B --> C[Non-Member: ✗]
    C --> D[Search for Matches]
    D --> E{Matches Found?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Create Match Record]
    F --> G[Status: group_onboarding]
    G --> H[Send: Join group message + membership guidance]
    H --> I[User Provides Wallet Address]
    I --> J[Execute Trust Transaction]
    J --> K{Already Trusted?}
    K -->|No| L[Blockchain Trust Transaction]
    L --> M[Status: group_joined]
    M --> N[Auto-trigger Introduction]
    N --> O[Status: introduction_outgoing]
    K -->|Yes| P[Status: ready_for_introduction]
    P --> Q[Skip to Introduction]
```

##### Flow 3: Non-Member with No Available Matches (Invitation Flow)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requests Connection] --> B[Check Group Membership]
    B --> C[Non-Member: ✗]
    C --> D[Search for Matches]  
    D --> E{Matches Found?}
    E -->|No| F[Create Invitation Record]
    F --> G[Status: invitation_sent]
    G --> H[Send: Join group invitation]
    H --> I[User Provides Wallet Address]
    I --> J{Already Trusted?}
    J -->|No| K[Execute Trust Transaction]
    K --> L[Update Invitation: invitation_completed]
    L --> M[User Now Available for Future Matching]
    J -->|Yes| N[Update Invitation: invitation_completed]
    N --> M
```

#### State Validation Logic

##### CIRCLES_TRUST Action Validation
The trust action validates when a user provides a wallet address AND meets one of these conditions:

```typescript
// Check for group_onboarding match (user has match but needs group membership)
const hasGroupOnboardingMatch = matches.some(match => 
  (match.user1Id === userId || match.user2Id === userId) && 
  match.status === 'group_onboarding'
);

// Check for active invitation (user invited due to no matches)
const hasActiveInvitation = invitations.some(invitation =>
  invitation.invitedUserId === userId && 
  invitation.status === 'invitation_sent' &&
  invitation.type === 'circles_invitation'
);

return hasWalletAddress && (hasGroupOnboardingMatch || hasActiveInvitation);
```

##### INTRO_PROPOSAL Action Validation  
Introduction proposals validate for matches in specific states:

```typescript
const validStatuses = [
  'ready_for_introduction',  // Both users are group members
  'group_joined'             // User just joined, ready for intro
];

return matches.some(match => 
  (match.user1Id === userId || match.user2Id === userId) &&
  validStatuses.includes(match.status)
);
```

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases

##### Duplicate Match Prevention
- System checks existing matches before creating new ones
- Prevents multiple match records between same user pairs
- Maintains referential integrity across state transitions

##### Trust Status Verification  
- All matches filtered to only include verified group members
- Non-trusted users cannot be matched with existing members
- Trust status checked at multiple validation points

##### Invitation Cleanup
- Completed invitations marked with timestamps
- Prevents duplicate invitations to same user
- Invitation status updated after successful group joining

#### Database Schema Integration

```sql
-- Match records with status tracking
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user1_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user2_id UUID NOT NULL, 
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  compatibility_score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user1_id, user2_id)
);

-- Invitation tracking for no-match scenarios  
CREATE TABLE invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  invited_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  invitation_reason VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- User group membership tracking
CREATE TABLE user_trust_status (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42),
  trust_transaction_hash VARCHAR(66),
  circles_group_ca VARCHAR(42),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

This state management system ensures reliable user journey tracking while handling complex scenarios like duplicate prevention, trust verification, and seamless transitions between different user types and connection outcomes.
