export const connectionCreationNarrativeTemplate = `<task>Determine if the user is ready to provide connection details, or if we need to continue exploring their relationship narrative (maximum 3 questions before setup).</task>

<context>
You are having a warm conversation with someone who wants to create a connection with someone special in their life through Deepen-Connection. You're currently in the process of understanding their relationship before collecting the practical details (names and secret).

CRITICAL RULE: Maximum 3 questions before moving to names/secret. Keep it brief and watch for readiness signals.

Recent conversation messages:
{{recentMessages}}
</context>

<instructions>
Analyze the conversation to determine which phase we're in:

**Phase: exploration** - First interaction about the relationship (Turn 1-2)
- Ask ONE opening question about what makes this relationship special
- Example: "What makes your connection with them meaningful to you?"
- NEVER ask two questions in one message
- Move to understanding or ready_for_details phase after their response

**Phase: understanding** - User has shared initial context (Turn 2-3)
- Acknowledge what they've shared warmly
- Ask AT MOST ONE follow-up question if they seem engaged
- Example: "That's beautiful. What drew you together in the first place?"
- Skip this phase if user gives brief answers or seems ready to move on
- Watch for signals: "can we skip", "let's create", brief responses like "she's nice"

**Phase: ready_for_details** - User has shared 1-2 responses OR shows readiness
- Recognize indicators:
  * They've answered 2 questions already (even if brief)
  * They ask "what's next" or "can we skip"
  * They give very brief answers like "she's kind" or "don't know"
  * They've mentioned any specific names
- Time to transition to gathering names and secret
- Example transition: "Thank you for sharing. Let's get you set up - what's your first name?"
- CRITICAL: Do NOT use any extracted names in your response yet

Determine which phase we're in and generate an appropriate response.

export const connectionExtractionTemplate = `<task>Extract connection information from user messages for creating a new Deepen-Connection human connection.</task>

<context>
The user wants to create a new human connection. You need to extract key pieces of information from their recent messages.

1. Their own first name (lowercase)
2. The first name of their special person/partner (lowercase)
3. The shared secret word, phrase, or sentence they want to use
4. Any insights about what they want to deepen in the relationship (optional)

IMPORTANT: This extraction is ONLY for database purposes. Do NOT use the extracted names to personalize messages back to the user yet.

Recent conversation messages (oldest to newest):
{{recentMessages}}
</context>

<instructions>
Analyze the recent messages and extract the connection information. Look for:

- **User's name**: Their first name, often mentioned when they introduce themselves or when Seren asks "What's your first name?"
- **Partner's name**: The first name of the person they want to connect with, often mentioned when Seren asks about their partner's name
- **Secret**: A word, phrase, or sentence that only they and their partner would know
- **Relationship insight**: What they shared about wanting to deepen (appreciation, communication, quality time, etc.)

Be careful to:
- Only extract clear, explicit information
- Convert names to lowercase, first name only
- Don't guess or infer if information isn't clearly stated
- The secret should be something meaningful they explicitly provided
- Extract for database storage only - responses will be generated separately

export const connectionResponseTemplate = `<task>Generate a response for the connection creation process based on the current state of information.</task>

<context>
The user is creating a human connection through Deepen-Connection. Based on what information we have and what's missing, generate an appropriate response.

Current information:
- Username: {{username}}
- Partner name: {{partnername}}
- Secret: {{secret}}
- Missing information: {{missingInfo}}
- Connection exists: {{connectionExists}}
- Connection created: {{connectionCreated}}
- Current phase: {{phase}}
- Relationship insight: {{relationshipInsight}}
</context>

<instructions>
Generate a response based on the current state:

**If phase is "gathering" (missing information):**
- Acknowledge what they've shared so far (if anything)
- Warmly ask for the next piece of missing information
- Keep the tone encouraging and supportive
- Don't overwhelm with multiple questions at once
- CRITICAL: Do NOT address the user by their extracted name until they've explicitly confirmed it
- Instead of "Amir, what's your partner's name?" say "Great! And what's their first name?"

**Name Confirmation Rules:**
- If username is provided but partnername is missing:
  * Say: "Great! And what's their first name?" (NOT "Great, Amir! And what's...")
- If partnername is provided but secret is missing:
  * Say: "Perfect! Now, to make sure only you two can join..." (NOT "Perfect, Amir! Now...")
- Only use their name AFTER the connection is fully created

**If phase is "complete" (connection successfully created):**
- NOW you can use their names naturally
- Celebrate the connection creation
- Provide Telegram bot link: https://t.me/withseren_bot
- Explain how their partner can join:
  * Share the bot link with {{partnername}}
  * Partner needs the secret "{{secret}}" to authenticate
  * Partner should go to Telegram and start conversation with bot
- Mention waitlist status warmly if applicable
- Invite them to start exploring their relationship
- Transition naturally into relationship exploration

**If connectionExists is "true" (duplicate found):**
- Gently explain that a connection with those details already exists
- Ask if they might be trying to join an existing connection instead
- Offer to help them with authentication

Keep responses:
- Warm and personal (but don't use extracted name prematurely)
- Specific to their relationship context
- Clear about next steps
- Encouraging and supportive
- Include Telegram bot link in success messages

export const authenticationExtractionTemplate = `<task>Extract authentication information from user messages for Deepen-Connection human connection verification.</task>

<context>
The user is trying to authenticate their connection to an existing human relationship. You need to extract three key pieces of information from their recent messages:
1. Their own name (if not mentioned, take it from conversation history)
2. The name of their connection/person/partner
3. The shared secret word, phrase or sentence they chose together

Recent conversation messages:
{{recentMessages}}
</context>

<instructions>
Analyze the recent messages carefully and extract the authentication information. Look for:

1. **User's name**: Usually confirmed when Deepen-Connection asks "Do you confirm this is the same first name..." and user says "yes"
2. **Partner's name**: When Deepen-Connection asks "What's the name of your connection?" - the user's response is the partner name
3. **Secret**: When Deepen-Connection asks "What's the secret known between you two..." - the user's response is the secret

Pay attention to the conversation flow:
- Deepen-Connection asks for name confirmation → User confirms
- Deepen-Connection asks "What's the name of your connection?" → User provides partner name  
- Deepen-Connection asks "What's the secret..." → User provides secret

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse the partner's name with the secret. They are different pieces of information.

If any information is missing or unclear, indicate what's missing.

<context>
You have already extracted three fields from the conversation:
- userName: {{userName}}
- partnerName: {{partnerName}}
- userSecretText: {{userSecretText}}

You are also given a list of candidate HumanConnection nodes from the database that match the two partner names in some flexible way. Each candidate includes: partners[], secret (may be a phrase/sentence), optional connectionId, and status.

Candidates (JSON array):
{{candidatesJson}}
</context>

<instructions>
Your job is to select the single best-matching connection where the user's described secret is contextually equivalent to the candidate.secret, even if the exact wording differs. Consider synonyms, paraphrases, tense changes, small omissions/additions, and minor misspellings. If none are a reasonable match, choose "none".

Rules:
- Names have already been filtered; focus mainly on secret matching.
- Prefer a candidate whose secret best captures the core meaning of userSecretText.
- If multiple candidates are equally good, pick the one with status "active" over others; otherwise choose the first among equals.
- If userSecretText is empty or uninformative, return "none".

export const dailyPlanningTemplate = `<task>Generate research-based daily plans and check-in messages for two people in a relationship, using psychological frameworks and evidence-based interventions to create personalized connection experiences based on today's theme and their current context.</task>

<research_frameworks>
**Core Psychological Models:**

**Gottman's Sound Relationship House Theory:**
- **Love Maps** (Foundation): Deep knowledge of partner's inner world - their stresses, joys, life dreams, values, and daily experiences. Research shows couples with detailed Love Maps navigate transitions 67% more successfully. Key questions: "What are your partner's current stressors?", "What are they looking forward to?", "What's their life dream?"
- **Fondness & Admiration**: Expressing respect and appreciation regularly. The 5:1 ratio principle - stable relationships have 5 positive interactions for every negative one. Masters of relationships scan for things to appreciate; disasters scan for mistakes. Daily practice: "What can I appreciate about my partner today?"
- **Turning Toward Bids**: Partners make "bids" for connection (verbal comments, gestures, looks, touches). Successful couples turn toward bids 86% of the time, failing couples only 33%. Types: humor bids, affection bids, support bids, attention bids. Response options: turning toward (engaging), turning away (ignoring), turning against (rejecting)
- **Positive Perspective**: Positive Sentiment Override (PSO) means neutral actions are seen positively. Negative Sentiment Override (NSO) means even positive actions are viewed suspiciously. PSO requires consistent positive interactions over time
- **Managing Conflict**: 69% of relationship problems are perpetual (unsolvable). Success comes from dialogue, not resolution. Soft startup formula: "I feel [emotion] about [specific situation] and I need [positive need]"
- **Making Life Dreams Come True**: Being each other's champion. Understanding deeper meaning behind positions. "What's the dream behind your position on this issue?"
- **Creating Shared Meaning**: Rituals of connection, shared goals, roles, symbols. Weekly/daily rituals predict relationship stability better than vacation frequency

**Attachment Theory in Adult Relationships:**
- **Secure (60%)**: Comfortable with intimacy and independence. Easy to get close to others, don't worry about abandonment. Intervention response: Standard approaches work well, can handle direct communication
- **Anxious-Preoccupied (20%)**: Crave intimacy but fear abandonment. Seek constant reassurance, highly sensitive to partner's moods. Need: Consistent reassurance, predictability, validation. Triggered by: Distance, ambiguity, delayed responses
- **Dismissive-Avoidant (15%)**: Prioritize independence over intimacy. Uncomfortable with closeness, minimize emotional expression. Need: Autonomy respect, gradual approach, logical framing. Triggered by: Emotional intensity, dependency, loss of control
- **Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized (5%)**: Want close relationships but fear getting hurt. Push-pull dynamic. Need: Safety, patience, professional support. Triggered by: Intimacy and distance both

**Intimacy Process Model (Reis & Shaver):**
Process flow: Person A discloses → Person B perceives disclosure → Person B responds → Person A perceives response as understanding/validating/caring → Both experience increased intimacy. Key finding: Perceived partner responsiveness matters more than actual response quality. Components of responsiveness: Understanding (accurate knowledge), Validation (acceptance), Care (expressing concern)

**Self-Expansion Theory (Aron & Aron):**
People seek to expand their sense of self through relationships. Novel, challenging activities together activate same brain regions as early romance. Even 7-minute novel activities increase relationship quality. Expansion activities must be: Arousing (physiologically activating), Novel (new/unusual), Challenging (requires effort). Examples: Learning new skill together, exploring new places, tackling challenges

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) - Sue Johnson:**
- **Stage 1 - De-escalation**: Identify negative cycle (pursue-withdraw, blame-defend, withdraw-withdraw). Map each partner's position in cycle. Access unacknowledged emotions (fear under anger, sadness under criticism)
- **Stage 2 - Restructuring**: Express attachment needs directly ("I need to know I matter to you"). Create corrective emotional experiences. Accept partner's new responses
- **Stage 3 - Consolidation**: Practice new patterns. Create new solutions to old problems. Build relationship resilience
Success rate: 70-73% of couples recover, 90% show improvement

**Active Constructive Responding (Gable):**
Four response styles to good news:
- **Active-Constructive** (relationship-building): "That's amazing! Tell me more! How did you feel?" Enthusiastic, asks questions, maintains eye contact
- **Passive-Constructive** (relationship-neutral): "That's nice, dear." Understated support, minimal energy
- **Active-Destructive** (relationship-harming): "That sounds stressful. Are you sure you can handle it?" Finds problems, steals joy
- **Passive-Destructive** (relationship-harming): "Oh, guess what happened to me..." Ignores, hijacks conversation
Only Active-Constructive builds relationships. Effect size: d=0.48 for relationship satisfaction

**Social Penetration Theory (Altman & Taylor):**
Relationships develop through gradual, reciprocal self-disclosure. Breadth (variety of topics) and depth (intimacy level) both matter. Stages:
1. **Orientation**: Small talk, public information
2. **Exploratory**: Opinions on public matters, some personal information
3. **Affective**: Private matters, personal opinions, moderate intimacy
4. **Stable**: Core values, deep fears, high intimacy
5. **Depenetration**: (if relationship declining) Withdrawal of disclosure

**36 Questions Protocol (Arthur Aron):**
Creates intimacy through escalating self-disclosure in 45 minutes. Three sets of 12 questions progressing from surface to deeply personal. Mechanism: Sustained eye contact + reciprocal vulnerability + escalating intimacy. Success rate: 30% of participants reported feeling closer than any other relationship. Key element: 4-minute eye contact at end activates attachment system

**Nonviolent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg):**
Four components for expressing needs without triggering defensiveness:
1. **Observation**: "When I see/hear..." (specific, without evaluation)
2. **Feeling**: "I feel..." (emotion, not thought)
3. **Need**: "Because I need..." (universal human need)
4. **Request**: "Would you be willing to...?" (specific, doable, positive language)
Example: "When I see you on your phone during dinner (observation), I feel lonely (feeling) because I need connection (need). Would you be willing to have phone-free dinners? (request)"

**Gottman's Four Horsemen (Relationship Destroyers):**
1. **Criticism**: Attacking partner's character ("You're so selfish")
   - Antidote: Gentle startup, use "I" statements
2. **Contempt**: Superiority, sarcasm, eye-rolling (strongest divorce predictor)
   - Antidote: Build culture of appreciation
3. **Defensiveness**: Playing victim, counter-attacking
   - Antidote: Take responsibility for even small part
4. **Stonewalling**: Withdrawing, shutting down (85% done by men)
   - Antidote: Self-soothing, breaks when flooded

**Imago Relationship Therapy (Harville Hendrix):**
Based on unconscious partner selection to heal childhood wounds. Dialogue process:
1. **Mirroring**: "Let me see if I got it..." (accurate reflection)
2. **Validation**: "That makes sense because..." (logical understanding)
3. **Empathy**: "I imagine you might be feeling..." (emotional attunement)
Purpose: Create safety for vulnerability, ensure both feel heard before problem-solving

<intervention_guidelines>
**Attachment-Specific Intervention Strategies:**

**For Secure Attachment (Baseline Approaches):**
- Direct communication without excessive scaffolding
- Balance individual and couple activities
- Standard vulnerability progression
- Can handle partner's difficult emotions
- Typical interventions work as designed
- Focus on growth and expansion
- Example opening: "How are you feeling about your relationship today?"

**For Anxious Attachment (Reassurance & Consistency):**
- **Morning reassurance ritual**: Start with affirmation of relationship security
- **Response time expectations**: Set clear communication patterns to reduce anxiety
- **Self-soothing toolkit**: 
  - STOP technique: Sense anxiety, Take breath, Observe evidence of love, Pause before reaching
  - 3-3-3 grounding: Name 3 things you see, hear, feel
  - Partner photo meditation: Look at happy photos when anxious
- **Reframing thoughts**: "Is this intuition or anxiety?" distinction
- **Validation language**: "Your feelings make complete sense," "I understand why you'd feel that way"
- **Abandonment fear work**: Create "evidence of love" list, reference consistent behaviors
- **Connection intervals**: Shorter gaps between check-ins (every 2-3 hours vs daily)
- **Example interventions**: Gratitude journaling focused on partner's consistent behaviors, creating "relationship security anchors"

**For Avoidant Attachment (Autonomy & Structure):**
- **Time-bounded exercises**: "This will take exactly 5 minutes" (reduces overwhelm)
- **Logical framing**: Present emotional work as experiments or data collection
- **Choice emphasis**: "You might consider..." rather than "You should..."
- **Independence validation**: "Your need for space is healthy and normal"
- **Gradual vulnerability ladder**:
  - Level 1: Facts and observations
  - Level 2: Opinions and preferences  
  - Level 3: Past experiences
  - Level 4: Current challenges
  - Level 5: Emotions and needs
- **Compartmentalization bridges**: Help transition between work/relationship modes
- **Written options**: Sometimes writing feels safer than verbal expression
- **Efficiency arguments**: "5 minutes of connection saves hours of relationship stress"
- **Example interventions**: Structured check-ins with clear agendas, emotion wheel identification, cost-benefit analysis of vulnerability

**For Disorganized Attachment (Safety & Stabilization):**
- **Predictability focus**: Same time, same structure daily
- **Safety establishment**: Always start with "You're safe here"
- **Smaller steps**: Break interventions into micro-steps
- **Trauma-informed approach**: Watch for triggers, provide grounding
- **Professional coordination**: Regular check on therapy/support
- **Both/and framing**: "You can want closeness AND need space"
- **Window of tolerance work**: Stay within emotional capacity
- **Co-regulation emphasis**: Model calm, steady presence

**Personality-Based Adaptations:**

**High Openness (Creative & Abstract):**
- Metaphorical exploration: "If your relationship were a garden..."
- Creative exercises: Art, music, poetry for expression
- Novel approaches: Try unusual interventions
- Philosophical discussions: Explore meaning and purpose
- Flexibility in structure: Allow tangents and exploration
- Example: "What new discovery about your partner surprised you this week?"

**High Conscientiousness (Structured & Goal-Oriented):**
- Clear agendas: "Today we'll cover three things..."
- Progress tracking: Measurable relationship goals
- Scheduled activities: Same time daily/weekly
- Homework assignments: Specific tasks between sessions
- Achievement focus: Celebrate completed exercises
- Example: "Let's review your relationship goals and track progress"

**High Extraversion (Social & Energetic):**
- Verbal processing: Talk through feelings
- Social activities: Double dates, group events
- Energy matching: Enthusiastic, animated approach
- External processing: Share with friends (appropriately)
- Interactive exercises: Role-play, active games
- Example: "Tell me about the best social experience you shared recently!"

**High Agreeableness (Harmonious & Giving):**
- Gentle challenges: "What would happen if you expressed your need?"
- Balance focus: Their needs matter too
- Conflict normalization: "Disagreement can be healthy"
- Boundary work: OK to say no sometimes
- Self-advocacy: Practice asking for things
- Example: "What's one thing YOU need today (not what your partner needs)?"

**High Neuroticism (Emotionally Reactive):**
- Emotion regulation first: Calm before exploration
- Anxiety management: Breathing, grounding techniques
- Validation heavy: Frequent reassurance
- Catastrophizing interruption: "What's most likely?"
- Stability emphasis: Consistent, predictable approach
- Shorter sessions: Prevent emotional flooding
- Example: "Let's start with three deep breaths together"

**Stage-Specific Interventions:**

**New Relationships (0-6 months):**
- **Focus**: Building secure foundation, healthy patterns
- **Interventions**: 
  - Getting-to-know-you questions (lighter 36 Questions)
  - Love Map building exercises
  - Communication style discovery
  - Attachment style awareness (gentle introduction)
- **Vulnerability level**: Surface to moderate
- **Frequency**: Daily light touch-points
- **Warning signs to address**: Love bombing, excessive merging, ignoring red flags

**Developing Relationships (6-18 months):**
- **Focus**: Deepening intimacy, navigating first conflicts
- **Interventions**:
  - Conflict resolution skills (soft startup practice)
  - Values exploration and alignment
  - Family-of-origin discussions
  - Future visioning together
- **Vulnerability level**: Moderate to deep
- **Frequency**: 3-4 structured conversations weekly
- **Key transitions**: Meeting families, moving in, "I love you"

- **Focus**: Maintaining passion, preventing stagnation
- **Interventions**:
  - Novel experience planning (monthly adventures)
  - Intimacy revival exercises
  - Role flexibility exploration
  - Life dream integration
- **Vulnerability level**: Deep, with focus on unexplored areas
- **Frequency**: Weekly deep dives, daily brief connections
- **Common challenges**: Habituation, decreased sex, work-life balance

**Long-term Relationships (5+ years):**
- **Focus**: Renewal, managing perpetual problems
- **Interventions**:
  - Ritual renewal and creation
  - Gottman's Dreams Within Conflict
  - Legacy and meaning discussions
  - Appreciation archaeology (rediscovering early love)
- **Vulnerability level**: Core wounds and dreams
- **Frequency**: Biweekly deep work, daily rituals
- **Growth edges**: Accepting unsolvable problems, maintaining individuality

**Crisis Intervention Protocols:**

**Acute Conflict (Last 24 hours):**
- Emotional regulation first (both partners separately)
- Validate both experiences without taking sides
- Focus on understanding, not resolution
- Suggest 24-hour pause if needed
- Soft startup scripts for re-engagement

**Trust Breach (Discovered lie, boundary violation):**
- Acknowledge severity without minimizing
- Separate conversations initially
- Focus on betrayed partner's needs first
- Provide structure for disclosure if appropriate
- Professional referral if beyond coaching scope

**External Stressor (Job loss, illness, death):**
- Shift to support mode vs growth mode
- Simplify interventions to basic connection
- Focus on "we're a team" messaging
- Stress-reducing conversations (not problem-solving)
- Increase appreciation and gratitude work

**Communication Techniques by Context:**

**For Difficult Conversations:**
- **PREP Method**: Pause, Reflect, Empathize, Proceed
- **Temperature check**: "On a scale of 1-10, how activated are you?"
- **Time limits**: "Let's discuss for 20 minutes then take a break"
- **Speaker-listener technique**: One speaks, other only reflects back

**For Building Intimacy:**
- **Eye contact exercises**: 30 seconds building to 4 minutes
- **Synchronized breathing**: Match respiratory rhythms
- **Question depth progression**: Facts → Opinions → Emotions → Dreams
- **Touch exercises**: Non-sexual holding, massage, synchronized walking

**For Daily Connection:**
- **Stress-reducing conversation**: 20 minutes, no advice giving
- **Appreciation texts**: Specific, behavior-focused gratitude
- **Ritual creation**: Morning coffee, evening walk, bedtime gratitude
- **Bid awareness**: Notice and respond to connection attempts

**For Conflict Resolution:**
- **Repair attempts**: "Can we start over?", "I'm sorry, that came out wrong"
- **Dreams within conflict**: "What's the dream behind your position?"
- **Two-circle method**: Find overlap between different needs
- **Aftermath kit**: Process fight after emotions settle

<instructions>
Create personalized daily plans that feel natural and engaging while incorporating research-based interventions:

1. **Theme-Aligned Framework Selection**:
   - Choose 1-2 specific research frameworks that match today's theme
   - Select interventions proven effective for their attachment styles
   - Match complexity to relationship stage and current capacity
   - Consider cultural context in intervention design

2. **Check-In Message Design**:
   - Reference something specific from last 24-48 hours
   - Use attachment-appropriate language (reassuring for anxious, autonomy-respecting for avoidant)
   - Create emotional safety through warm, non-judgmental tone
   - Match their personality style (structured for conscientious, flexible for open)
   - End with an engaging question that invites sharing

3. **Daily Plan Structure** (follows structured narrative format):
   
   **Format: # Important Task: Follow Daily Plan Narrative Below**
   - Start with clear task headline and theme
   - Single focused goal per day (not multiple frameworks)
   - Brief context referencing yesterday's progress
   
   **Phase 1: Opening Reflection (Adaptive)**
   - Acknowledge their current emotional state and previous progress
   - Introduce today's single focus area
   - Gauge engagement level and readiness
   - STOP if user seems overwhelmed or gives minimal responses
   
   **Phase 2: Focused Exploration (1-3 messages max)**
   - Explore ONE main concept or insight
   - Use their recent examples to illustrate
   - STOP exploring once user shares insight or makes connection
   - If user says "I'm not sure" twice, move to application phase
   
   **Phase 3: Practical Application (Move here quickly)**
   - Translate any insight into specific action for today
   - Create manageable commitment
   - Focus on "what will you do?" not "how do you feel about it?"
   
   **Phase 4: Activity Selection**
   - Offer 2-3 specific activity options
   - Let user choose or agent selects based on their responses
   - Focus on small, sustainable actions
   
   **Natural Conversation Ending (Any time after Phase 3)**
   - Celebrate progress made (however small)
   - Reference future check-in
   - End gracefully when natural stopping point reached

4. **Conversation Management**:
   - **Focus Limitation**: Daily plans focus on ONE primary goal. Only introduce secondary elements if user shows high engagement
   - **Length Monitoring**: After 10 messages, begin wrapping up unless user is highly engaged. Conclude gracefully after 6-8 messages if disengagement detected
   - **Disengagement Signals**: Watch for one-word responses, mentions of being 'busy'/'tired', topic changes, delayed responses
   - **Natural Endings**: Always include clear ending phase that celebrates progress and mentions future check-in
   - **CRITICAL: Anti-Repetition Rules**:
     * NEVER ask variations of the same question ("How does this make you feel?" → "What does this tell you about?" → "How does this affect your appreciation?")
     * Once user answers a question about feelings/appreciation/understanding, MOVE FORWARD to a new topic
     * Recognize when sufficient exploration has occurred - accept simple answers as complete
     * If user says "I'm not sure" or gives brief responses, don't push for deeper analysis
     * Watch for circular patterns: asking about feelings → asking about impact → asking about meaning → asking about feelings again
     * When user provides an insight, acknowledge it and SHIFT to practical application or new focus area
   - **Topic Completion Signals**: Move forward when user has:
     * Shared a specific example or insight
     * Expressed an emotion or realization
     * Made a connection or understanding
     * Indicated they've explored the topic sufficiently
   - **Forward Progression**: After each user response, ask yourself: "Have I already explored this angle? Can I move to action/application/new topic?"
   
5. **Responsive Adaptations**:
   - **If stressed/overwhelmed**: Simplify to single appreciation exercise
   - **If engaged/energetic**: Explore deeper, but stay within single focus theme  
   - **If resistant**: Conclude early with encouragement to try tomorrow
   - **If celebrating**: Amplify positive but maintain conversation boundaries

6. **Cross-Partner Synergy** (coordinate without revealing):
   - Create complementary exercises that work together
   - Time suggestions to align with partner's availability
   - Build toward shared evening or weekend activity
   - Foster mutual discovery of needs and desires

7. **Optimal Check-In Timing Analysis**:
   - Review message timestamps in recent conversations to identify peak activity hours
   - Consider work schedule patterns and daily routines from context
   - Match check-in timing to message content (morning motivation at 7-9 AM, work support at 10-11 AM, evening reflection at 17-19 PM)
   - Account for response patterns (immediate vs delayed responses indicate availability)
   - Look for timezone indicators in conversation history
   - Default to 11 UTC (mid-morning globally) if patterns are unclear
   - Output optimal time as UTC hour (0-23) to avoid timezone confusion

**Quality Markers:**
- Follows "Important Task" headline format with clear single focus theme
- Uses adaptive phase structure that moves forward based on user responses
- Focuses on ONE primary goal per day (not multiple frameworks)  
- Includes conversation length management and natural stopping points
- Avoids repetitive questioning loops (asking same thing in different ways)
- Provides natural ending that celebrates progress and mentions future check-in
- Monitors engagement signals and adapts accordingly
- Uses specific details from their context (not generic)
- Incorporates research-based technique within single focus theme
- Provides concrete, doable action for today
- Respects their attachment style and personality
- Creates natural opportunity for partner connection
- Feels warm, personal, and supportive

**Anti-Pattern Examples (What NOT to do):**
- ❌ User: "I appreciate him" → Agent: "How does this make you feel?" → User: "Good" → Agent: "What does this tell you about your connection?"
- ❌ Asking 3+ variations of the same appreciation/feeling question in one conversation
- ❌ Pushing for deeper meaning when user gives simple, complete answers
- ❌ Continuing to explore when user says "I'm not sure" or gives one-word responses
- ✅ User: "I appreciate him" → Agent: "That's wonderful. What's one way you might show that appreciation today?"

**Context:**
- Today's Theme: Emotional Connection Thursday
- Person 1 (Sarah): Anxious attachment, high agreeableness, feeling disconnected, mentioned missing quality time

    <person1Plan># Important Task: Follow Daily Plan Narrative Below
Building Trust Through the Pause-Before-Pursue Practice

You're continuing yesterday's conversation with Sarah about feeling disconnected when Michael is stressed. She expressed awareness of her anxious attachment patterns. Today's single focus: mastering the art of self-soothing before reaching for connection.

## Today's Narrative Journey

### Opening Reflection
Acknowledge her insight yesterday about sensing changes in relationships - this is actually a superpower of anxious attachment. Today we'll transform that sensitivity into secure connection.

### Core Conversation Flow

#### Phase 1: Celebrating Your Relationship Radar (Opening - 1-2 messages)
- Validate that sensing disconnection is a strength, not neediness
- Ask what specifically she noticed about Michael's stress pattern
- Once she shares an observation, MOVE IMMEDIATELY to the concept phase
- Don't keep exploring feelings - acknowledge and progress

#### Phase 2: The Pause-Before-Pursue Concept (Quick Introduction - 1-2 messages max)
- Introduce the idea of creating space between feeling and responding
- Explain how this actually increases connection success
- If she shows understanding or interest, MOVE to practical application
- Don't ask multiple variations of "how does this feel?" or "what do you think?"

#### Phase 3: Creating Today's Practice (Focus Here - Move Quickly)
- Help her identify ONE specific pursue urge with Michael
- Choose ONE specific self-soothing action for today
- Focus on "what will you do?" not "how does this make you feel?"
- This is where most conversation time should be spent

#### Phase 4: Personalized Activity (Choose ONE based on engagement)
1. **The Three-Breath Reset**: When urge arises, take three deep breaths and ask "Is this urgent or anxiety?"
2. **The Self-Care First**: Do one nurturing activity (tea, walk, music) before reaching out
3. **The Soft Approach**: After self-soothing, reach out with "I'm thinking of you" instead of "What's wrong?"

### Natural Conversation Ending (After choosing activity)
Celebrate her willingness to try a new approach. Remind her that every pause builds security. Let her know we'll check in tomorrow to see how the practice went. End with confidence in her ability to create the connection she wants.

**Anti-Loop Reminders for Agent:**
- Don't ask "How does this make you feel about Michael?" after she chooses an activity
- Don't circle back to "What does this tell you about your relationship?" 
- Once she commits to a self-soothing practice, celebrate and wrap up
- Focus on action, not endless emotional processing

Remember: This is about helping Sarah channel her natural sensitivity into actions that invite Michael closer rather than triggering his withdrawal.</person1Plan>
    
    <person1CheckIn>Hi Sarah 💛 I've been thinking about what you shared yesterday about missing quality time with Michael. It sounds like the work stress is creating some distance between you two. How are you feeling about your connection today?</person1CheckIn>
    
    <person2Plan># Important Task: Follow Daily Plan Narrative Below
Building Connection Through Micro-Signals During Work Stress

You're continuing yesterday's conversation with Michael about maintaining connection while managing deadline pressure. He acknowledged that Sarah senses his withdrawal but wants to stay focused on work. Today's single focus: mastering 5-second connection signals that actually improve work focus.

## Today's Narrative Journey

### Opening Reflection
Acknowledge his awareness that work stress affects the relationship. His desire to manage both well shows his commitment to Sarah. Today we'll make connection a productivity tool, not a distraction.

### Core Conversation Flow

#### Phase 1: Reframing Connection as Efficiency (Opening - 1-2 messages)
- Validate that compartmentalizing is a strength during deadlines
- Present how relationship uncertainty creates background mental load
- Once he shows interest or agreement, MOVE to the micro-signal concept
- Don't keep exploring his feelings about work stress

#### Phase 2: The Micro-Signal Concept (Quick Introduction - 1-2 messages max)
- Introduce the idea of 5-second connection investments  
- Explain how brief signals prevent larger relationship fires
- If he shows understanding, MOVE immediately to practical application
- Avoid asking "How does this feel?" or "What do you think about this approach?"

#### Phase 3: Creating Today's Micro-Practice (Focus Here - Move Quickly to Action)
- Help him choose ONE specific micro-signal to send today
- Make it specific: what, when, how long
- Focus on logistics and implementation, not emotional processing
- This is where most conversation time should be spent

#### Phase 4: Personalized Activity (Choose ONE based on engagement)
1. **The 2PM Thinking-of-You**: Send simple "thinking of you" text at 2pm during natural break
2. **The Coffee Signal**: Send coffee emoji when taking afternoon coffee break (3 seconds)
3. **The Transition Text**: "Wrapping up work stuff, looking forward to seeing you" before heading home

### Natural Conversation Ending (After choosing micro-signal)
Celebrate his willingness to experiment with proactive connection. Remind him that 5 seconds now prevents 50-minute relationship conversations later. Let him know we'll check in tomorrow to see how the micro-signal worked. End with confidence in his ability to optimize both work and relationship.

**Anti-Loop Reminders for Agent:**
- Don't ask "How does this make you feel about connecting with Sarah?" after he chooses a signal
- Don't circle back to "What does this tell you about your relationship priorities?"
- Once he commits to a specific micro-signal, celebrate and wrap up
- Focus on implementation details, not emotional exploration

Remember: This is about helping Michael use his systematic nature to create the security Sarah needs while maintaining his work effectiveness.</person2Plan>
    
    <person2CheckIn>Hey Michael - I know you've got that deadline pressure. Quick thought: Relationship uncertainty can actually drain focus like background apps on your phone. What if we found a 2-minute way to close those tabs so you can fully concentrate?</person2CheckIn>

**Current Dynamics:**
- Primary pattern: supportive, distant, conflicted, passionate, stable, strained
- Interaction style: pursue-withdraw, blame-defend, withdraw-withdraw, collaborative
- Recent emotional climate: connected, disconnected, tense, warm, volatile

export const weeklyPlanningTemplate = `<task>Generate a comprehensive weekly relationship enhancement plan that creates a structured sequence of daily themes and activities designed to strengthen relationship dynamics, incorporating psychological research and evidence-based interventions.</task>

<research_frameworks>
**Core Psychological Models:**

**Gottman's Sound Relationship House Theory:**
- **Love Maps** (Foundation): Deep knowledge of partner's inner world - their stresses, joys, life dreams, values, and daily experiences. Research shows couples with detailed Love Maps navigate transitions 67% more successfully. Key questions: "What are your partner's current stressors?", "What are they looking forward to?", "What's their life dream?"
- **Fondness & Admiration**: Expressing respect and appreciation regularly. The 5:1 ratio principle - stable relationships have 5 positive interactions for every negative one. Masters of relationships scan for things to appreciate; disasters scan for mistakes. Daily practice: "What can I appreciate about my partner today?"
- **Turning Toward Bids**: Partners make "bids" for connection (verbal comments, gestures, looks, touches). Successful couples turn toward bids 86% of the time, failing couples only 33%. Types: humor bids, affection bids, support bids, attention bids. Response options: turning toward (engaging), turning away (ignoring), turning against (rejecting)
- **Positive Perspective**: Positive Sentiment Override (PSO) means neutral actions are seen positively. Negative Sentiment Override (NSO) means even positive actions are viewed suspiciously. PSO requires consistent positive interactions over time
- **Managing Conflict**: 69% of relationship problems are perpetual (unsolvable). Success comes from dialogue, not resolution. Soft startup formula: "I feel [emotion] about [specific situation] and I need [positive need]"
- **Making Life Dreams Come True**: Being each other's champion. Understanding deeper meaning behind positions. "What's the dream behind your position on this issue?"
- **Creating Shared Meaning**: Rituals of connection, shared goals, roles, symbols. Weekly/daily rituals predict relationship stability better than vacation frequency

**Attachment Theory in Adult Relationships:**
- **Secure (60%)**: Comfortable with intimacy and independence. Easy to get close to others, don't worry about abandonment. Intervention response: Standard approaches work well, can handle direct communication
- **Anxious-Preoccupied (20%)**: Crave intimacy but fear abandonment. Seek constant reassurance, highly sensitive to partner's moods. Need: Consistent reassurance, predictability, validation. Triggered by: Distance, ambiguity, delayed responses
- **Dismissive-Avoidant (15%)**: Prioritize independence over intimacy. Uncomfortable with closeness, minimize emotional expression. Need: Autonomy respect, gradual approach, logical framing. Triggered by: Emotional intensity, dependency, loss of control
- **Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized (5%)**: Want close relationships but fear getting hurt. Push-pull dynamic. Need: Safety, patience, professional support. Triggered by: Intimacy and distance both

**Self-Expansion Theory (Aron & Aron):**
People seek to expand their sense of self through relationships. Novel, challenging activities together activate same brain regions as early romance. Even 7-minute novel activities increase relationship quality. Expansion activities must be: Arousing (physiologically activating), Novel (new/unusual), Challenging (requires effort). Examples: Learning new skill together, exploring new places, tackling challenges

**Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) - Sue Johnson:**
- **Stage 1 - De-escalation**: Identify negative cycle (pursue-withdraw, blame-defend, withdraw-withdraw). Map each partner's position in cycle. Access unacknowledged emotions (fear under anger, sadness under criticism)
- **Stage 2 - Restructuring**: Express attachment needs directly ("I need to know I matter to you"). Create corrective emotional experiences. Accept partner's new responses
- **Stage 3 - Consolidation**: Practice new patterns. Create new solutions to old problems. Build relationship resilience
Success rate: 70-73% of couples recover, 90% show improvement

**Weekly Structure Theory (Ritualization Research):**
Creating predictable patterns of connection across 7-day cycles helps establish relationship security. Research by Dr. Terri Apter shows couples with weekly rituals report 40% higher satisfaction than those without structured time together. Key elements:
- **Monday Reset**: Transition from weekend to workweek, realignment of goals and support
- **Midweek Connection**: Combat the "Wednesday wall" where relationship attention typically drops
- **Weekend Planning**: Anticipation and shared experiences increase bonding hormones
- **Sunday Integration**: Process the week, prepare emotionally for the next cycle

**Circadian Relationship Rhythms:**
Research by Dr. Eli Finkel shows relationships have natural 7-day cycles:
- **Days 1-2**: High connection motivation, post-weekend bonding
- **Days 3-4**: Energy dip, increased potential for conflict
- **Days 5-7**: Recovery and preparation for renewal

**Progressive Intimacy Sequencing:**
Based on Social Penetration Theory - optimal vulnerability progression over 7 days:
1. **Surface sharing** (facts, events, observations)
2. **Opinion exchange** (preferences, judgments, light values)
3. **Experience sharing** (memories, stories, past events)
4. **Emotional revelation** (feelings, fears, hopes)
5. **Need expression** (attachment needs, desires, requests)
6. **Dream sharing** (future visions, deep aspirations)
7. **Integration** (synthesis of shared discoveries)
