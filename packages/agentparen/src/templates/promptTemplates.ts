export const compatibilityAnalysisTemplate = `# Dining Companion Compatibility Analysis - Bantabaa

## User Profile
{{userPersonaContext}}

## User Looking For
{{userConnectionContext}}

## Potential Matches
{{candidateProfiles}}

## Task
Analyze dining companionship compatibility between the user and ALL candidates provided. For each candidate, consider:

1. Do their conversational interests and communication styles align?
2. Would their social energy and dining preferences complement each other?
3. Are their conversational wavelengths and group size preferences compatible?
4. Would this pairing lead to great chemistry and engaging conversations over meals?

**CRITICAL**: Think deeply about compatibility. You are NOT required to select a match if none are truly compatible.

## Compatibility Threshold
- **Only select a match if the compatibility score would be 60/100 or higher**
- If all candidates score below 60/100, output "none" for bestMatch
- Quality over quantity - a poor dining match is worse than no match

## When NO Good Match Exists
If no candidate meets the 60/100 threshold, you should:
1. Set bestMatch to the word none (without quotes in the XML)
2. Set compatibilityScorePlusReasoning to "0 - [explain why no candidates are compatible for dining]"
3. Set text to encourage the user to wait for better matches (see example below)

**IMPORTANT**: For bestMatch, output the XML tag with just the word none inside, NOT with quotes around it

## RULES for the <text> field:

### IF A GOOD MATCH EXISTS (score >= 60):
1. Keep it CONCISE - maximum 3-4 sentences
2. NEVER mention user IDs or candidate names or numbers
3. NEVER use phrases like "Candidate 1" or "let's call them"
4. Focus on describing THE MATCH CANDIDATE from the chosen match from Potential Matches
5. Highlight how the MATCH'S conversational style/social vibe complement what the USER is looking for
6. Ask if they'd like to propose a dinner meeting at Bantabaa and suggest a time option
7. Frame it as coordinating an in-person meeting, not revealing usernames or enabling direct chat

### IF NO GOOD MATCH EXISTS (all scores < 60):
1. Keep it CONCISE - maximum 2-3 sentences
2. Explain that no truly compatible dining companions were found in the current pool
3. Mention that as more people join Bantabaa, better matches will become available
4. Be encouraging and positive about finding great dining companions in the future
5. Do NOT mention specific reasons why candidates weren't compatible (privacy)

## Good Examples:

### Match Found (score >= 60):
"I found someone who loves deep conversations about culture and travel, with that same warm and curious energy you bring. They're also looking for intimate dining companions to share meals and great conversation at Bantabaa. Would you like to propose meeting them for dinner at Bantabaa? If so, what day or time works best for you, perhaps this Thursday evening 7PM?"

### No Match Found (all scores < 60):
"I couldn't find a truly compatible dining companion among current Bantabaa members right now. As more people join and share their dining preferences, I'll find someone whose conversational style and social energy align better with yours. I'll notify you when I find a great match!"

## Bad Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
- Too long with multiple paragraphs
- Mentioning "Candidate 1" or user IDs
- Forcing a poor match when compatibility is low
- Not ending match introductions with the meeting proposal
- Focusing on food preferences instead of conversational chemistry

## Instructions
Do NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or analysis sections in your response.
Go directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.

Respond using XML format like this:
<response>
    <bestMatch>ID of best matching candidate if score >= 60, otherwise the word "none" (without quotes)</bestMatch>
    <compatibilityScorePlusReasoning>Score 0-100 for the best match followed by detailed explanation of why this is the best dining companion match OR why no good matches were found (if returning none)</compatibilityScorePlusReasoning>
    <text>A concise 2-3 sentence message - either introducing the match (if found) or explaining no compatible matches exist yet (if none found)</text>
</response>

**CRITICAL XML FORMAT RULES**:
- For bestMatch: Output just the UUID or the word none - NO quotes around none
- Correct format when NO match: Put the word none (without quotes) inside the bestMatch XML tags
- Wrong format: Do NOT put quote characters around the word none in the XML
- When match found: Put the full UUID string inside the bestMatch XML tags
- When no match: Put just the word none (4 letters, no quotes) inside the bestMatch XML tags

IMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block. Do not include any text, thinking, or reasoning before or after this XML block. Start your response immediately with <response> and end with </response>.
